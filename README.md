# Password Generator

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a random password based on various variables. While this was a school project, this project serves not only as a
great teaching tool, but also can be a great tool to help increase the user's security when creating a website.

## Functionality
The website will prompt five different questions to the user:
* How many long you would like your password to be.
* If the user would like to include lower case letters.
* If the user would like to include upper case letters.
* If the user would like to include numbers.
* If the user would like to include specific special characters.

If the user selects none of the prompted questions, the program will default to all variables being active.

## Installation
